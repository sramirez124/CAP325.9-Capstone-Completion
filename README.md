  <h2>What is Herculean Task App?</h2>
  <p> Herculean Task List is an app that allows users to create their own task list, you can add a description of the task and a due date. I enjoy checking out new task list apps so I wanted to develop my       own. There are more features to come
  </p>

  <h2>Road Map</h2>
  <p>There are definitely more features I want to add and things I want to fix to work more efficiently. SPRINT 4 will include these items.</p>
  <ul>
    <li> Allow users to delete task and connect it with DELETE </li>
    <li> Work on styling of the pages </li>
    <li> Allow users to make projects and store task to a certain project </li>
    <li> A profile that tracks users stats like how many projects/task they have completed </li>
  </ul>
