  <h2>What is Herculean Task App?</h2>
  <p> Herculean Task App is a task app that was developed for capstone project at Per Scholas for a MERN Fullstack developer course that I am currently taking and will be graduate from late November.
      I always love trying out a new "task app" as I call them so I figured this would be a great time to make my own and see what I can do. The goal is pretty simple. I want my app to help people
      save task for a project and keep things organized. I also want to give stats to people on their profile that shows how many projects they have completed and how many task they have completed.
